# study_spaces

### Problem
We are often not conscious of our micro-decisions such as where we choose to spend the day studying. For many, the study space has surprising effects on a studentâ€™s mood, productivity, and stress levels. Can study location data be used to offer insights into student academic activity/performance?

### Example Load Sample Database
[our approach](https://medium.com/flutterpub/flutter-how-to-do-crud-with-postgresql-part-1-57d8d3652a31) (for sql)

### Resources
- [flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [postgresql for dart](https://pub.dev/packages/postgres)
- [mongodb for dart](https://pub.dev/packages/mongo_dart)
